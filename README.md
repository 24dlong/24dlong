## What makes me tick
I love building things.

In my first job after college, I worked as an Operations Analyst at Tesla. At the time, my most advanced technical skill was performing a `VLOOKUP` in Excel. Walking to and from my desk at the Fremont factory, I was dazzled by some of the most advanced manufacturing technology in the world, but after a few months on the job, I found myself even more dazzled by all the systems and software working behind the scenes.

Ever since, I've been building and learning. Along the way, I've been continually inspired by all the technology I've encountered, and the potential of all that which has yet to be built.
