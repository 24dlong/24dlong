## What makes me tick
I love building things.

In my first job after college, I worked as an Operations Analyst at Tesla. At the time, my most advanced technical skill was performing a `VLOOKUP` in Excel. Walking to and from my desk at the Fremont factory, I was dazzled by some of the most advanced manufacturing technology in the world, but after a few months on the job, I found myself even more dazzled by all the systems and software running behind the scenes.

I discovered Udemy and started learning basic HTML and CSS during my shuttle rides to work. Ever since, I've been building and learning, and I found there was so much to learn. And there's so much to build, which is good, because I love building things.
